CLAS 12 Software
=================

- CLAS12 Data Explorer: Data Explorer for CLAS12 data. It allows plotting any CLAS12 detector sub-syatem with cuts with few clicks.
- CLAS12 DC Calibration: DC Calibration suite for CLAS12
- Clas12lib: My personal verson of CoatJava. It's just some additional layers added on top of official CoatJava package to make life easier.

Please read the README file inside each package for detailed instructions for that specific package.
